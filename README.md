# This Repo can be used to predict neural responses to image stimuli.
1. It is mostly based on the neural predictors repo from the Sinz lab.
2. I planned to make this entire thing more structured: the modules_unfinished are this unfinished attempt.
3. The modules_simple contain pretty much everything I used (sorry for the boiler plate code...).
4. I trained on sensorium data, data from awake mice and data from anesthetized mice, from subiculum and V1.
5. The notebooks are hopefully pretty self-explanatory, I am trying to comment the code better in the future.
